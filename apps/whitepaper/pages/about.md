## About PenX

PenX is a decentralized protocol designed to help indie creators connect with their "1,000 True Fans."

## 1,000 True Fans Theory

16 years ago, in 2008, Kevin Kelly introduced the concept of "[1,000 True Fans](https://kk.org/thetechnium/1000-true-fans/)." He believed that creators only need to build a loyal fanbase to achieve financial sustainability and artistic freedom.

The idea of "1,000 True Fans" suggests that creators do not need millions of followers to survive. Instead, having 1,000 dedicated fans who are willing to support everything a creator does can provide sustainable income. These fans are characterized by their loyalty and deep engagement with the creator's work. They actively support the creator, whether by purchasing merchandise, attending events, or promoting their work to others.

personally I resonate with this theory.

## The Problem

While Kevin Kelly proposed a great theory, but there was a lack of practical solutions to implement it.

## The Solution

PenX has created a decentralized protocol and client to help indie creators connect with their "1,000 True Fans."

**PenX consists of two core components**:

- **Protocol Layer**: A set of smart contracts running on the blockchain
- **Client Layer**: A front-end application built on the PenX Protocol

**Core Features of PenX**:

- **Streaming Web3 Subscriptions**: An innovative subscription payment method that makes it easier for users to subscribe and unsubscribe.
- **Monetize Indie Creators**: Each creator can monetize their community and use that currency for subscriptions and payments.

## Definition of Indie Creators

Indie creators, in this context, are individuals and small teams that create original content and products, distinct from traditional companies. This includes:

- Independent developers
- Writers
- Designers
- Artists
- Musicians
- Filmmakers

In my view, the indie creator typically refers to a small team, like three people.

In Web3 terms, they should be seen as micro DAO.

## How Future Companies Will Be Organized

We believe that DAO are the future of team organization. For creators, the best structure is a micro DAO, where each creator should establish their own micro DAO.

PenX's Space is a nice tool to help creators build their micro DAO.

## Mission

Beyond helping indie creators connect with their "1,000 True Fans," PenX aims to make it easier for creators to launch their creative careers.
